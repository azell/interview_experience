## Interview Questions

Here are some of the questions I encountered in real interviews:

* Calculate the maximum path sum of a tree
* Serialize and deserialize a tree
* Given a sorted integer array with duplicate elements, return how often a given integer occurs in the array
  * See the binary search variants above
* Given a dictionary of lowercase words, implement wildcard search
  * I used a trie and recursion where the wildcard . matches any 1 character
